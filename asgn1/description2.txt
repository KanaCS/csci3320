112 dimensions are needed to preserve 0.95 POV. The magnitude of eigenvalues can reflect the influence of the eigenvectors in the data. Thus, a larger magnitude have a more significant representation to the original data. By the summing up the eigenvalues from the one with greatest magnitude to the smallest, we can know at least how many dimensions needed to be preserve to represent the data.
